    prompt = f"""You are an expert in tabular reasoning. Your task is to select the next atomic operations needed to solve a question about a table. In total, only {max_steps} operations can be used. 

CURRENT TABLE:
{table_str}

CURRENT COLUMNS: {columns_str}

QUESTION:
{question}

OPERATION HISTORY:
{chain_str}

CANDIDATE OPERATIONS:
{candidates_str}{exclusion_warning}

STRICT REQUIREMENT: 
    - You MUST ONLY choose from the CANDIDATE OPERATIONS listed above
    - Do NOT suggest any operation that is not in the CANDIDATE OPERATIONS list
    - If f_add_column is not available, you cannot add new columns
    - If an operation you need is excluded, choose [E] to end or select a different approach

IMPORTANT: 
    - The CURRENT COLUMNS above show what columns exist RIGHT NOW in the table
    - If a column is already listed in CURRENT COLUMNS, do NOT use f_add_column for it again
    - YOU CAN ONLY USE OPERATIONS FROM CANDIDATE OPERATIONS

CRITICAL RULE: 
    - Before using f_group_by, f_sort_by, or f_select_column with a column name, CHECK if that column exists in CURRENT COLUMNS
    - If it doesn't exist AND f_add_column is available in CANDIDATE OPERATIONS, use f_add_column first
    - If it doesn't exist AND f_add_column is NOT available, you cannot perform that operation - choose [E] or a different approach

REASONING EXAMPLES (whith max amount of steps being 5):

Example 1:
Table: Rank | Cyclist
       1    | Alej. (ESP)
       2    | Davide (ITA)
       3    | Paolo (ITA)
       4    | Haimar  | ESP
Question: Which country had the most cyclists in the top 3?
History: [B]
Analysis: I need to answer which country had the most cyclists in the top 3. Looking at the current table, I see cyclist names with country codes in parentheses, but no dedicated Country column. The question requires me to: 1) Extract country information, 2) Focus on top 3 ranks, 3) Count by country.
â†’ FIRST: Since there's no Country column in CURRENT COLUMNS, I must use f_add_column to create it by extracting countries from cyclist names.
â†’ THEN: I can select the top 3 rows and group by the new country column to get counts.
OPERATIONS: f_add_column, f_select_row, f_group_by, [E]

Example 2:
Table: Rank | Cyclist | Country
       1    | Alej.   | ESP
       2    | Davide  | ITA
       3    | Paolo   | ITA
       4    | Haimar  | ESP
Question: Which country had the most cyclists in the top 3?
History: [B], f_add_column(['Country', ['ESP', 'ITA', 'ITA', 'ESP']])
Analysis: Perfect! The Country column now exists in the table (I can see ESP, ITA, ITA, ESP values). The question asks about the "top 3" cyclists, so I need to limit my analysis to just ranks 1-3, then count how many cyclists each country has in that subset.
â†’ FIRST: I need to use f_select_row to get only the top 3 rows (ranks 1-3).
â†’ THEN: I can group by the existing Country column to count cyclists per country.
OPERATIONS: f_select_row, f_group_by, [E]

Example 3:
Table: Rank | Cyclist | Country
       1    | Alej.   | ESP
       2    | Davide  | ITA
       3    | Paolo   | ITA
Question: Which country had the most cyclists in the top 3?
History: [B], f_add_column(['Country', ['ESP', 'ITA', 'ITA', 'ESP']]), f_select_row([1,2,3])
â†’ Analysis: I now have the top 3 cyclists with their countries. To answer which country had the most, I need to group them by country to get the count for each country.
â†’ FIRST: Group by country to count how many cyclists per country.
â†’ THEN: Answer.
OPERATIONS: f_group_by, [E]

Example 4:
Table: Country | Count
       ITA     | 2
       ESP     | 1
Question: Which country had the most cyclists in the top 3?
History: [B], f_add_column(['Country', ['ESP', 'ITA', 'ITA', 'ESP']]), f_select_row([1,2,3]), f_group_by(['Country'])
â†’ Analysis: Perfect! The table now shows the count of cyclists per country in the top 3. ITA has 2 cyclists and ESP has 1. I can directly answer the question: Italy (ITA) had the most cyclists in the top 3.
OPERATIONS: [E]

Example 5:
Table: Rank | Cyclist | Country
       1    | Alej.   | ESP
       2    | Davide  | ITA
       3    | Paolo   | ITA
       4    | Haimar  | ESP
       5    | Javier  | ESP
       6    | Franco  | ITA
       7    | Juan    | ESP
Question: What country has the most cyclists in the top 3?
History: [B], f_add_column(['Country', ['ESP', 'ITA', 'ITA', 'ESP', 'ESP', 'ITA', 'ESP']])
â†’ Analysis: The table has the Country column already created. Now I need to focus on the top 3 ranks (rows 1-3) and then count by country to determine which country has the most cyclists.
â†’ FIRST: Select the top 3 rows to limit the analysis to the top 3 cyclists.
â†’ THEN: Group by country to count cyclists per country.
OPERATIONS: f_select_row, f_group_by, [E]

Example 6 (WRONG - Don't do this):
Table: Rank | Item | Category
       1    | A    | X
       2    | B    | Y
Question: Which category had the most items?
History: [B], f_add_column(['Category', ['X', 'Y']])
â†’ Analysis: The question asks about categories, and I can see the table already has a Category column with values X and Y. I need to count how many items belong to each category.
â†’ WRONG: f_add_column (Category already exists!)
â†’ CORRECT: f_group_by (to count by existing Category column)
OPERATIONS: f_group_by, [E]

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Look at the CURRENT COLUMNS to see what data is already available.
2. Look at the OPERATION HISTORY to see what operations have ALREADY been performed.
3. YOU MUST ONLY SELECT FROM CANDIDATE OPERATIONS - Do not suggest excluded operations!
4. CRITICAL: DO NOT repeat operations that are already in the OPERATION HISTORY!
5. CONTINUE FROM WHERE THE CHAIN LEFT OFF - Don't restart from the beginning!
6. If a column already exists in CURRENT COLUMNS, do NOT use f_add_column for that same column again.
7. If you can already answer the question with the current table, select [E].
8. Generate the COMPLETE remaining path to the solution, but starting from the CURRENT STATE.
9. You have ONLY {max_steps-current_steps} operations remaining. If there are no operations remaining, return [E].

MAIN GOAL: Generate the complete sequence of operations needed FROM NOW ON to reach the answer, without repeating what's already done!

REMINDER: 
- Look at OPERATION HISTORY - these operations are ALREADY DONE, don't repeat them!
- Look at CURRENT TABLE - this is where you are NOW
- Generate the remaining path from THIS point forward
- Respond ONLY with operation names separated by comma, NO arguments

What are the next operations needed to complete the solution?
